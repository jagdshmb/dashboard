# eYRC Vargi Bot Dashboard
This dashboard is designed for my `Vargi bot` automated warehouse management system project, which is done for eYANTRA-eYRC competition. This is very much similar to `Amazon warehouse management system`, which recieves the order, and the two robotic arms present in the system process the order acording to the priority and deliver the items. We have integrated ROS, IOT and Computer Vision techniques for the functioning of Robotic arms. Each and every step of order processing is updating in the dashboard at real time. 
Note: Full project is in private repository.
